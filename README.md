# Minesweeper

Minesweeper implemented in Python

NOTE
haravasto.py is not written by me.

This is final assignment for Programming 1 course in Oulu University implemented by me.
You can play the game by running the minesweeper.py file.

The game works just as the classic minesweeper game and it saves statistics of played games to the .txt file.
